# Orginisation
What we do is important to ensure freedom, no matter what device you use. Some code is in development and isn't available to be publicly seen. Their repos will still appear alongside their Read Me, allowing you to see what we're coming up with next. We have a Discord server at discord.gg/tzmqQyXcF5.
